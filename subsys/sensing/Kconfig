	int "maximum sensitivity count one sensor could support"
	depends on SENSING
	default 6
	help
	  This is the maximum sensitivity count one sensor could support,
	  some sensors such as ALS sensor could define different sensitivity for each data filed,
	  So, maximum sensitivity count is needed for sensors
	  Typical values are 6

config SENSING_RING_BUF_SIZE

	help
	  This is the ring buffer to store sensor data that
	  will be posted to application
	  Typical values are 16 * 1024

	int "maximum sensor data size"
	depends on SENSING
	default 64
	help
	  This is the maximum sensor data size sensing subsystem could support
	  when sensor is posting data to client, sensing subsystem would
	  get no more than SENSING_MAX_SENSOR_DATA_SIZE sensor count from ring buffer
	  Typical values are 64

	  This is the stack size for sensing subsystem runtime thread
	  Typical values are 4096

	int "priority for sensing subsystem runtime thread"
	depends on SENSING
	default 9
	help
	  This is the thread priority for sensor subsystem runtime thread
	  Ring buffer data is stored by runtime thread, and then give semaphore
	  to notify dispatch thread, runtime thread priority should lower than
	  dispatch thread priority to ensure dispatch thread could fetch data as
	  soon as runtime thread give semaphore. Take for example, if runtime
	  priority is higher than dispatch thread, and runtime running in full
	  loading with no sleep, then dispatch thread has no change to fetch
	  data, then ring buf will always be put into data until overflow.
	  Typical values are 9

config SENSING_DISPATCH_THREAD_PRIORITY
	  int "priority for sensor dispatch thread"
	  depends on SENSING
	  default 8
	  help
	    This is the thread priority for sensing subsystem dispatch thread
	    Ring buffer data should be fetched ASAP, so Dispatch
	    thread priority should be higher than runtime thread
	    Typical values are 8
